# About
This repository was made for the purposes of introducing Unit Testing and GitHub integration for C346. 

# Progress
The files within have been modified to include Unit Tests for a basic implementation of a linked list. 
The linked list implements a given interface to achieve the expected effects.
The Unit Tests were generated using NetBean's JUnit and customized to test the features for expected performance and defects.

A driver file was purposely omitted since the objective was Unit Testing practice.
